Functions for ISO 226:2003 Equal-loudness contours
==================================================

This project contains the ISO 226 interpolation functions included in the pydsm
library, authored by Sergio Callegari.

This project has been forked from pydsm for use as a dependency, rather than
including the whole of pydsm, to prevent dependency conflicts with the cvxopt
version that is included with pydsm if a new cvxopt is required.
